    "You should make at least one commit to your repository per computational task below - usually more.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you must create a new Jupyter notebook called MA934_Class2_UniID.ipynb to contain the implementations that you write. You can separate out individual tasks if you prefer, but the full submission should be made as a single .zip via [our website](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/courses/msc/ma934/resources/assessedwork/ma934declaration). The platform will not allow you to upload more than one file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few tips:\n",
    "- please make sure to debug intermediate outputs as you code along. You are welcome to design smaller test cases and toy problems to verify your work (even if they are not part of the final submission).\n",
    "- consider possible forms of input or arguments and make sure your solution can cope with *interesting* cases.\n",
    "- do not forget to comment your code and use Markdown cells to explain what you are doing. A perfectly functional solution with no information about the thought process will not receive more than a subset of the points (~$70\\%$ depending on the difficulty of the problem and how transparent the algorithm flow is). \n",
    "- generally getting used to writing tidy solution is good practice. Feel free to use [online resources](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watson-studio-local/1.2.3?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet) for editing guidance."
