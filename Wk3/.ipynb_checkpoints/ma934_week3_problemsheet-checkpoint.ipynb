    "A problem to rekindle our love for physics. Our inital motivation for studying derivative approximation is (partly) grounded in solving real-world problems (in true MathSys spirit). Such an example is provided by solving a variation of the **beam deflection problem**, sketched below (see Chapra, Steven C., and Raymond P. Canale. Numerical methods for Engineers. Vol. 1221. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011 for details):\n",
